# Rabi-Ribi

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Items which the player would normally acquire throughout the game have been moved around. Logic remains, so the game is
always able to be completed, but because of the item shuffle, the player may need to access certain areas before they
would be expected to in the vanilla game.

## What is the goal of Rabi-Ribi in Archipelago

The goal of Rabi-Ribi is to find Easter Eggs shuffled throughout Rabi Rabi Island. Collecting
all of the Easter Eggs will complete your seed.

Setting the goal to completing the main story is not currently implemented, as the game is beatable with no items.

## What items and locations can get shuffled?

- All upgrades and abilities
- All badges
- All potions and attack upgrades

## What does another world's item look like in Rabi-Ribi?

Items for another player will show up as an exclamation point!
Upon pickup, the player name and item can be seen in the text client.
