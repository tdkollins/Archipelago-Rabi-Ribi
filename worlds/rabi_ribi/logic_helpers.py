    This method converts a rule from the existing randomizer to a lambda which can be passed to AP.

    OpBacktrack exists in the standalone randomizer for two-way entrances that can only be opened
    from one side. Since AP logic assumes the player can warp to the starting location,
    these entrances add nothing to the graph and can be safely ignored.

    OpLit is used to evaluate a single literal statement. This can be having an item, or
    can be more complex (e.g. conjunction of literals), which is combined into a single literal
    in the existing randomizer. For the more complicated literals, Ive defined methods above to
    translate them, and placed them in the below "literal_eval_map". If its not in the below map,
    assume the literal is an item which we can check the state for.

    The other Ops are self explanatory, and are translated accordingly.
