    For simplicity, I did not implement backtrack (yet), since its kind of hacky, complex,

    OpLit is used to evaluate a single literal statement. This can be having an item, or
    can be more complex (e.g. conjunction of literals), which is combined into a single literal
    in the existing randomizer. For the more complicated literals, Ive defined methods above to
    translate them, and placed them in the below "literal_eval_map". If its not in the below map,
    assume the literal is an item which we can check the state for.

    The other Ops are self explanatory, and are translated accordingly.
